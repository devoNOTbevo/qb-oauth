# qb-oauth
a quick class demonstrating an OAuth2.0 implementation - in this case the Quickbooks api using the node library

These modules can be exported to a server.js file, implemented as middleware, and utilized in an application that uses the OAuth2.0 standard - even for server-to-server communication.  I wrote this while working with the Quickbooks API which requires the full OAuth2.0 process, so the OAuth routes wrap an application that can access the Quickbooks API
